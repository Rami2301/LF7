Individual Learning Goal
==========================

During the hackathon, I aim to learn how to implement a computer vision-based facial recognition system and integrate it into a smart home security system.

DIY Problem Definition – 5WH Method
=====================================

***What***

What is the problem? Security for smart homes, specifically controlling access with facial recognition.

***Why***

Why is it important? More and more people want to secure their homes, especially against break-ins. Facial recognition can make access control safer and automated.

***Who***

Who is affected? People who want more security at home, especially homeowners or renters in areas where security is a concern.

***Where***

Where does the problem occur? In homes, apartments, or offices that need extra security.

***When***

When does the problem occur? Particularly when the home is unoccupied or at night when access needs to be monitored.

***Security Features***
- Facial Recognition: Automatic recognition of authorized users and blocking of unauthorized access
- Emergency Alarm: Triggering of an alarm in case of unauthorized access or other security threats
- Notification: Notification of the homeowner in case of unauthorized access or other security threats
- Not able to loose a Key or copy fingerprints like on a Keypad

***Comfort Features***
- Automatic Door Opening: Automatic opening of the door upon recognition of an authorized user
- Smart Home Integration: Integration with other smart home devices for comprehensive control of the house
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive operation of the system
- Personalization: Possibility to adapt the system to the individual needs of the user

“How Facial Recognition Can Make Your Home Safer”

Content
In a world where security is becoming increasingly important, our facial recognition technology offers an innovative solution for homeowners. With this smart solution, doors only open for authorized individuals. Security you can trust—without the need for keys.

Ideate
==========

***Dream***



- A facial recognition technology that automatically unlocks the door when an authorized user stands in front of it.
- An emergency alarm that is triggered when unauthorized access to the house occurs.
- A notification to the homeowner's smartphone with a picture of the visitor.
- An integration with other smart home devices to offer a comprehensive security solution.
- An option to lock or unlock specific areas of the house as needed.

***Reality***
How realistic is it to make the dream part true?

- Technical feasibility: 8/10 - Facial recognition technology is already available and can be integrated with smart home devices. However, there may be technical challenges in implementing the system, such as ensuring accurate recognition and avoiding false positives.
- Cost: 6/10 - The cost of implementing a facial recognition system can be high, especially if it requires specialized hardware and software. However, the cost can be reduced by using existing smart home devices and integrating them with the facial recognition system.
- User acceptance: 9/10 - Many users are already comfortable with using facial recognition technology, such as Apple's Face ID. However, there may be concerns about privacy and security, which need to be addressed.
- Regulatory compliance: 7/10 - There may be regulatory requirements that need to be met, such as ensuring that the system complies with data protection laws. However, these requirements can be addressed through careful planning and implementation.


***Critique***

- The facial recognition technology is an innovative solution, but it must also be secure and reliable.
- The emergency alarm is important, but it must also be designed to avoid frequent false triggers.
- The notification to the smartphone is a good idea, but it must also be designed to avoid sending unnecessary notifications.
